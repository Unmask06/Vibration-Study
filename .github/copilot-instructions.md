# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Objective
- Help users write VBA code efficiently by providing relevant code snippets, functions, and best practices.

Always refer to the architecture.md for context. 

## Response style for Copilot
- Prefer small PRs; include docstring + usage snippet.

In agent mode, If unsure, insert `TODO (?)` instead of guessing.

## Coding Standards
- dont create new modules unless specified.
- Use existing modules and functions wherever possible.
- Use consistent naming conventions and coding styles as per existing codebase.
- Ensure code is modular, reusable, and well-documented. Modular but not so much that it becomes fragmented.
